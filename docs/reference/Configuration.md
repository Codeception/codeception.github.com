# Configuration

## Global Configuration: `codeception.yml`

The global configuration file `codeception.yml` is generated by the `codecept bootstrap` command. Alphabetical list of options:

### `actor_suffix`

Sets the suffix for "Actor" classes. Default: `Tester`.  If you set it to `Ninja` and generate a new `api` test suite, you will get an `ApiNinja` actor class.

### `bootstrap`

Bootstrap script that will be executed before all suites. A script should be put into `tests` directory.

### `coverage`

[CodeCoverage](https://codeception.com/docs/11-Codecoverage#Configuration) settings.

### `extends`

Allows you to specify a file (relative to the `codeception.yml` file) that holds some already pre-defined values. This can be used to always use the same configuration for modules or whatever.

### `extensions`

Allows to enable and configure [Codeception extensions](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Extension), [Group Objects](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Group-Objects), and [Custom Commands](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Custom-Commands).

### `gherkin`

[Gherkin options](https://codeception.com/docs/07-BDD#Configuration).

### `include`

Include additional Codeception configurations for [multiple applications setup](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Namespaces).

### `modules`

Allows to create shared module configuration for all included suites.

{% highlight yaml %}
modules:
    config:
        Db:
            dsn: ''
            user: ''
            password: ''
            dump: tests/_data/dump.sql
{% endhighlight %}

### `namespace`

Sets the namespace under which all new tests and support classes will be generated. Allows to configure [multiple test setups for one runner](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Namespaces).

### `params`

Allows to pass [external parameters](https://codeception.com/docs/06-ModulesAndHelpers#Dynamic-Configuration-With-Parameters) into module configuration.

### `paths`

Directories used by Codeception. Default values:

{% highlight yaml %}
paths:
    tests  : tests          # where the tests stored
    data   : tests/_data    # directory for fixture data
    support: tests/_support # directory for support code
    output : tests/_output  # directory for output
    envs   : tests/_envs    # directory for environment configuration
{% endhighlight %}

### `reporters`

Allows to [change default reporters](https://codeception.com/docs/08-Customization#Custom-Reporters) of Codeception

### `settings`

Provide additional options for the test runner. They may dramatically change the way Codeception is executed. For instance, take a note of `shuffle` option which allows to randomize tests execution order and `lint` option that toggles parsing a test file (using `php -l`) before loading it.

{% highlight yaml %}

settings:

    # enable/disable syntax of test files before loading
    # for php < 7 exec('php -l') is used
    # disable if you need to speed up tests execution
    lint: true

    # randomize test order
    shuffle: true

    # by default it's false on Windows
    # use [ANSICON](https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon) to colorize output.
    colors: true

    # Generate XML JUnit report using strict schema
    # Avoid putting additional report fields like steps or scenario names to it
    # Required for XML reports on Jenkins CI
    strict_xml: false

    # Tests (especially functional) can take a lot of memory
    # We set a high limit for them by default.
    memory_limit: 1024M

    # This value controls whether PHPUnit attempts to backup global variables
    # See https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.annotations.html#appendixes.annotations.backupGlobals
    backup_globals: true

    # PHPUnit can be strict about tests that do not test anything
    # See https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/risky-tests.html#risky-tests.useless-tests
    report_useless_tests: false

    # PHPUnit can be strict about output during tests.
    # See https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/risky-tests.html#risky-tests.output-during-test-execution
    disallow_test_output: false

    # PHPUnit can be strict about tests that manipulate global state.
    # See https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/risky-tests.html#risky-tests.global-state-manipulation
    be_strict_about_changes_to_global_state: false

    # Log the incomplete and skipped tests into junit report
    # See https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/appendixes.configuration.html
    # Section logging > junit
    log_incomplete_skipped: false

    # Set the error_reporting level
    # You can specify either a predefined constant or an integer value
    # See https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php
    # See https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php
    error_level: E_ALL & ~E_STRICT & ~E_DEPRECATED

## Suite Configuration

Each generated suite have its own configuration inside directory set by `paths: tests: ` configuration option in `codeception.yml`. Each suite configuration is named like `suitename.suite.yml`. It allows to enable and configure modules, and more.

* `actor`: name of the actor class for current suite.
* `modules`: list of enabled modules with their configuration.

{% highlight yaml %}

modules:
    # enabled modules and helpers
    enabled:
        # built-in modules are listed by their names
        - PhpBrowser:
            # module configuration
            url: http://localhost
        # this module is pre-configured in global config
        - Db

        # helper names are listed by their class names
        # by convention their names start with \
        - \Helper\Acceptance

    # additional modules configuration
    # can be used for modules which are not currently enabled
    config:
        WebDriver:
            browser: firefox

    # list of modules disabled for this suite
    disabled:
        - WebDriver


{% endhighlight %}

* `extends`: allows you to specify a file (relative to the `*.suite.yml` file) that holds some already pre-defined values. This can be used to always use the same configuration for modules or whatever.
* `namespace`: default namespace of actor, support classes and tests.
* `suite_namespace`: default namespace for new tests of this suite (ignores `namespace` option)
* `env`: override any configuration per [environment](https://codeception.com/docs/07-AdvancedUsage#Environments).
* `groups`: [groups](https://codeception.com/docs/07-AdvancedUsage#Groups) with the list of tests of for corresponding group.
* `formats`: [formats](https://codeception.com/docs/07-AdvancedUsage#Formats) with the list of extra test format classes.
* `coverage`: per suite [CodeCoverage](https://codeception.com/docs/11-Codecoverage#Configuration) settings.
* `gherkin`: per suite [BDD Gherkin](https://codeception.com/docs/07-BDD#Configuration) settings.
* `error_level`: [error level](https://codeception.com/docs/04-FunctionalTests#Error-Reporting) for runner in current suite. Can be specified for unit, integration, functional tests. Passes value to `error_reporting` function. Suite specific value will override the global value.
* `bootstrap`:  bootstrap script that will be executed before current suites. A script should be put into suite directory.

## Config Templates (dist)

To provide the same configuration template for your development team, you can create a `codeception.dist.yml` config file, which will be loaded before `codeception.yml`. The dist config provides shared options, while local `codeception.yml` files override them on a per-installation basis. Therefore, `codeception.yml` should be ignored by your VCS system.

Config templates can also be used for suite configuration, by creating a `suitename.suite.dist.yml` file.

Configuration loading order:

1. `codeception.dist.yml`
2. `codeception.yml`
3. `acceptance.suite.dist.yml`
4. `acceptance.suite.yml`
5. environment config
