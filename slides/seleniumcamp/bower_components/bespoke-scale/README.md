# bespoke-scale

Responsive Slide Scaling for [Bespoke.js](https://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js)

## Download

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max], or use a [package manager](#package-managers).

[min]: https://raw.github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-scale/master/dist/bespoke-scale.min.js
[max]: https://raw.github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-scale/master/dist/bespoke-scale.js

## Usage

First, include both `bespoke.js` and `bespoke-scale.js` in your page.

Then, simply include the plugin when instantiating your presentation.

```js
bespoke.horizontal.from('article', {
  scale: true
});
```

By default, bespoke-scale detects which method to use for resizing slides. In browsers that support it, CSS `zoom` is used. In all other browsers, each slide is wrapped with an element with a `bespoke-scale-parent` class, which is resized with CSS transforms. You will need to provide styles for this element, for example:

```css
.bespoke-scale-parent {
  perspective: 600px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

If you'd like to specify which scaling method to use, you can pass `'zoom'` or `'transform'` as an option, for example:

```js
bespoke.horizontal.from('article', {
  scale: 'zoom'
});
```

## Package managers

### Bower

```bash
$ bower install bespoke-scale
```

### npm

```bash
$ npm install bespoke-scale
```

The bespoke-scale npm package is designed for use with [browserify](https://browserify.org/), e.g.

```js
require('bespoke');
require('bespoke-scale');
```
