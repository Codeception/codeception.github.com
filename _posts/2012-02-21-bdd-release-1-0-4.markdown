title: Codeception 1.0.4 Released. Behavior Driven Development.
date: 2012-02-21 01:03:50
---

This release brings a real behavior driven development to Codeception. Before that we talked about testing in BDD-style, but nothing about real development by behavior. There were just few changes made in code. More changes are coming to documentation. 

## Specifications

With Behavior Driven Development you start development of class by writing it's specifications. Specifications are written as methods of Cest class and start with 'should' word.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class EventMachineCest {

	$class = 'EventMachine';
	
	function shouldHaveInitialState() {}	
	function shouldMoveBetweenTransitions() {}
	function shouldMoveBetweenTransitionsOnCondition() {}
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

The _EventMachine_ class in example above is not written, but we've already defined what to expect from it. After a basic requirements are specified we can take a deeper look into it and describe how it should be used. From this point your specifications become a valid Codeception tests.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
class EventMachineCest  {

	$class = 'EventMachine';

   /**
	* @doc getState
	*/
	function shouldHaveInitialState(CodeGuy $I)
	{
		$em = new EventMachine;
		$I->executeMethod($em, 'getState')
			->seeResultEquals('initial');
	}
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

For full EventMachineCest example see my [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/1862951).

Codeception generates a pretty good documentation with [DocBlox](http://codeception.com/02-15-2012/unit-testing.html) based on your scenario. The @doc annotation marks that a getState method documentation will be updated by current test scenario.

{% highlight bash %}
I want to have initial state

I execute method $eventMachine, 'getState'
I see result equals 'initial'
{% endhighlight %}

## Scenarios

For making acceptnace tests usable for writing Stories we've added 2 new methods. It's _am_ and _lookForwardTo_ which represent 'As a ...' and 'So that' definitions from Story. 

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$I = new WebGuy();
$I->am('regular site user'); 		// As a regular user
$I->wantTo('create my blog page');  // I want to create my blog page
$I->lookForwardTo('get a cool blog here'); 	// So that I get a cool blog

$I->expect("blog can't be created twice");
$I->expect("blog has RSS feed");
$I->expect("am administrator of this blog");
?>
{% endhighlight %}

After that Cept can be extended in a valid Cept file. 
Refer to this [Gist demonstrates](https://gist.github.com/1844158) for example.
