title: Codeception 1.0.7 Released.

That was quite a long time after last version was released. This time we decided to skip version 1.0.6, just because 1.0.7 looks prettier. 

With this release Codeception can be used in CI systems like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). It's very easy: you  just append '--xml' option for running test and receive xml report in JUnit format stored in 'tests/_log' directory. Other popular formats like Json and TAP were added too. Here is a sample report.xml generated by Codeception test suite:

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<testsuites>
  <testsuite name="acceptance" tests="9" assertions="29" failures="0" errors="0" time="41.532108">
    <testcase file="Cli\BuildCept.php" name="test build command (Cli\BuildCept.php)" assertions="5" time="4.016982"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateCeptCept.php" name="generate sample cept (Cli\GenerateCeptCept.php)" assertions="5" time="15.401255"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateCestCept.php" name="generate sample cest (Cli\GenerateCestCept.php)" assertions="3" time="3.742880"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateScenariosCept.php" name="generate scenarios (Cli\GenerateScenariosCept.php)" assertions="3" time="3.668740"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateSuiteCept.php" name="generate sample suite (Cli\GenerateSuiteCept.php)" assertions="4" time="4.706381"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithHtmlCept.php" name="check xml reports (Cli\RunWithHtmlCept.php)" assertions="1" time="2.428402"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithJsonCept.php" name="check json reports (Cli\RunWithJsonCept.php)" assertions="2" time="2.692029"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithTapCept.php" name="check tap reports (Cli\RunWithTapCept.php)" assertions="2" time="2.459026"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithXmlCept.php" name="check xml reports (Cli\RunWithXmlCept.php)" assertions="4" time="2.416413"/>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>

Currently this reports are not perfect as for different file formats and you may lack some important information. For this cases, please create issues on GitHub or in Q&A section. 

Thanks to Nikita Groshin new module for [Kohana](https://kohanaframework.org/) Framework integration was added. Please, check it out for your Kohana projects and leave a feedback.

Thanks again to all contributors and reporters.

Please update your version via PEAR:
