That was quite a long time after last version was released. With this release Codeception can be used in CI systems like Jenkins. It's very easy: you  just append '--xml' option for running test and receive xml report in JUnit format stored in 'tests/_log' directory. Other popular formats like Json and TAP were added too. Here is a sample report.xml generated by Codeception test suite:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<testsuites>
  <testsuite name="acceptance" tests="9" assertions="29" failures="0" errors="0" time="41.532108">
    <testcase file="Cli\BuildCept.php" name="test build command (Cli\BuildCept.php)" assertions="5" time="4.016982"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateCeptCept.php" name="generate sample cept (Cli\GenerateCeptCept.php)" assertions="5" time="15.401255"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateCestCept.php" name="generate sample cest (Cli\GenerateCestCept.php)" assertions="3" time="3.742880"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateScenariosCept.php" name="generate scenarios (Cli\GenerateScenariosCept.php)" assertions="3" time="3.668740"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\GenerateSuiteCept.php" name="generate sample suite (Cli\GenerateSuiteCept.php)" assertions="4" time="4.706381"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithHtmlCept.php" name="check xml reports (Cli\RunWithHtmlCept.php)" assertions="1" time="2.428402"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithJsonCept.php" name="check json reports (Cli\RunWithJsonCept.php)" assertions="2" time="2.692029"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithTapCept.php" name="check tap reports (Cli\RunWithTapCept.php)" assertions="2" time="2.459026"/>
    <testcase file="Cli\RunWithXmlCept.php" name="check xml reports (Cli\RunWithXmlCept.php)" assertions="4" time="2.416413"/>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>
```

Currently this reports are not perfect as for different file formats and you may lack some important information. For this cases, please create issues on GitHub or in Q&A section. 

Thanks to Nikita Groshin new module for [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org) Framework integration was added. Please, check it out for your Kohana projects and leave a feedback.

Thanks again to all contributors and reporters.

Please update your version via PEAR:
