Today we are releasing Codeception 1.5.4. This is minor bugfixing release consisting of GitHub issues. 
And a small yet awaitied feature introduced: ability to skip and mark Cepts as incomplete.

It's pretty simple, though.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$scenario->skip();

$I = new WebGuy($scenario);
$I->wanTo('do something, but I would rather not');
$I->amOnPage('/');
//.....
?>
{% endhighlight %}

This makes this test to be skipped.
Similarly it can be marked as incomplete.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$scenario->incomplete();

$I = new WebGuy($scenario);
$I->wanTo('do something, but I would rather not');
$I->amOnPage('/');
//.....
?>
{% endhighlight %}

The `skip` and `incomplete` methods can take one argument, that descrines a reason why this tests were marked this way.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
$scenario->skip('waiting for new markup');
$scenario->incomplete('welcome page appearence not tested');
?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Bugfixes

* Symfony2 kernel is rebooted on each run. That make Symfony2 tests less dependent on each other. 
* `seeFillField` method now [accepts label as parameter](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/issues/162).
* [Encoding issues](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/issues/120) for non-latin chars in output fixed. Unfortunately this fix will work only in PHP 5.4.
* `seeLink` now doesn't [return false positive results](https://github.com/Codeception/Codeception/issues/90)
